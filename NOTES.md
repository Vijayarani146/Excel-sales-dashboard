# 🗒️ Project Notes – Excel Sales Dashboard (2018 - 2021)

## 🔧 How I Built It
- I collected sales data from 2020 to 2022 (fictional or sample dataset).
- Cleaned and structured the data in Excel for better readability.
- Pivot Tables were used to summarize key metrics like sales, profit, and quantity.
- Applied Slicers and Timeline filters to allow interactive filtering.
- Used various charts (Donut, Column, Line, Stacked Bar) to visualize performance across:
  - Categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
  - Order Sources (Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc.)
  - Global regions (North, Central, Oceania, etc.)
- Designed the dashboard layout using Excel formatting for visual clarity.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Choose the right chart types to compare multiple variables.
- Aligning KPIs and charts in a clean layout that works well in Excel.
- Creating slicers that are intuitive and don't clutter the dashboard.
- Maintaining consistent color coding across visuals for easy understanding.
